## Odds and Ends

Little code snippets that I re-use for random projects or habits

**deleting_raw.py** just deletes the RAW file if the JPEG pair is already deleted

**logdates.py** spits out a markdown formatted file to write down daily activities

**convert_flac_to_ogg** batch converts flac files to ogg opus from a directory tree


deleting_raw.m is retired

logdates.m is retired

logdates_archived.py is retired
