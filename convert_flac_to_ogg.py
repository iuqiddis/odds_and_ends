"""
Quick script to batch convert flac files in different folders to ogg files
that can be stored with the same directory tree pattern in a different folder

The input directory is a base directory which can have however many sub-directories
The output directory is where you want the output to go[

My music files are stored as ../music/Artist/Album/track.flac
The converted files will be saved as ../music_new/Artist/Album/track.ogg

If you want to save them in the same directory, make the flac and ogg directories 
    in the function the same.

If the folder that has songs also has cover art, it will be copied as well.

A note on ffmpeg: it's quite verbose and outputs to stderr. If you'd like to see 
    all the output, remove the `stderr=DEVNULL` option from the 'run(...)' call 

This script was used on linux (Ubuntu 20.04)
